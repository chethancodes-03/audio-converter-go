Audio Converter GO
Overview
Audio Converter GO is a simple audio file conversion tool built using the Go programming language. This tool utilizes SoX (Sound eXchange) to perform audio format conversions, specifically converting .WAV files to .FLAC format. The project includes real-time audio streaming and conversion features over WebSocket connections, allowing efficient handling of audio data.

The project is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easily extendable, making it suitable for future improvements or additional audio processing features.

Features
WAV to FLAC Conversion: Converts .WAV files to .FLAC format using SoX.
Real-Time Streaming: Supports streaming of audio data, ideal for handling large audio files or real-time conversions.
WebSocket Integration: Utilizes WebSocket connections to handle audio streaming and file conversion requests.
Concurrency Control: Implements a semaphore mechanism to limit concurrent connections and manage resources efficiently.
Test Cases: Includes test files for validating the conversion functionality and edge cases.

Prerequisites
Before you can run the Audio Converter GO project, make sure the following software is installed on your machine:

Go: Make sure you have Go installed. You can download and install it from here.

To check if Go is installed, run:

bash
Copy code
go version
SoX (Sound eXchange): The project depends on SoX for audio file conversion. Install it from here.

To verify SoX is installed, run:

bash
Copy code
sox --version
WebSocket Server: WebSocket handling is essential for streaming. Ensure that your environment supports WebSocket communication.

Git: If you plan to clone the repository, make sure Git is installed. You can download Git from here.

Setup
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/chethancodes-03/audio-converter-go.git
cd audio-converter-go
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure all the dependencies are installed by running:

bash
Copy code
go mod tidy
This command will automatically install the necessary dependencies mentioned in the go.mod file.

3. Set Up the Environment
If you're using a virtual environment for Python or testing scripts, set it up by following these steps:

bash
Copy code
# Set up a virtual environment (optional)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
4. WebSocket Server Configuration (Optional)
If you intend to run the WebSocket server, ensure the WebSocket server code in main.go is configured properly to handle incoming connections and audio streams. Modify any necessary parameters in the WebSocket server section to fit your specific environment.

Usage
Running the Converter
To run the audio converter, execute the main.go file:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
This will start the server and allow you to connect via WebSocket for audio streaming. If the server is working correctly, you should be able to convert .WAV files into .FLAC format.

Test Conversion
Ensure you have a .WAV file (e.g., file_example_WAV_2MG.wav) in your working directory.
Run the conversion script by executing the Go server.
Upon successful conversion, the output will be saved in .flac format (e.g., output.flac).
WebSocket Communication
To connect via WebSocket, you can use a WebSocket client (e.g., Postman or a custom WebSocket client script) to initiate a connection and stream the audio file to the server for conversion.

Testing with Test Files
The project includes test files such as test_tone_440hz.wav and maintest.go. You can use these files to validate the conversion functionality and ensure that the system works as expected:

bash
Copy code
# Run tests in maintest.go
go test maintest.go
This will execute any unit tests you have written to verify the conversion logic.

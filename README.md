# Audio Converter GO

## Overview

`Audio Converter GO` is a simple audio file conversion tool built using the Go programming language. This tool utilizes [SoX (Sound eXchange)](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) to perform audio format conversions, specifically converting `.WAV` files to `.FLAC` format. The project includes real-time audio streaming and conversion features over WebSocket connections, allowing efficient handling of audio data.

The project is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easily extendable, making it suitable for future improvements or additional audio processing features.

## Features

- **WAV to FLAC Conversion**: Converts `.WAV` files to `.FLAC` format using SoX.
- **Real-Time Streaming**: Supports streaming of audio data, ideal for handling large audio files or real-time conversions.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Utilizes WebSocket connections to handle audio streaming and file conversion requests.
- **Concurrency Control**: Implements a semaphore mechanism to limit concurrent connections and manage resources efficiently.
- **Test Cases**: Includes test files for validating the conversion functionality and edge cases.

## Folder Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the folder structure:

├── output.flac              # Converted audio file output in FLAC format
├── output2.flac             # Additional FLAC output (possibly for testing different cases)
├── output3.flac             # Another FLAC output (optional, for varied test scenarios)
├── test_tone_440hz.wav      # Another example input file for specific tone testing
├── test.py                  # Python script (if used, possibly for testing or auxiliary tasks)
```

## Prerequisites

Before running the `Audio Converter GO` project, ensure the following software is installed on your machine:

1. **Go**: [Install Go](https://golang.org/dl/).

   To check if Go is installed, run:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

2. **SoX (Sound eXchange)**: [Install SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/).

   To verify SoX is installed, run:
   ```bash
   sox --version
   ```

3. **WebSocket Server**: Ensure your environment supports WebSocket communication.

4. **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chethancodes-03/audio-converter-go.git
cd audio-converter-go
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install dependencies with:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 3. Set Up the Environment

If using a virtual environment for Python or testing scripts, set it up:

```bash
# Set up a virtual environment (optional)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### 4. WebSocket Server Configuration (Optional)

If using WebSocket, ensure `main.go` is configured properly to handle connections and audio streams. Adjust parameters in the WebSocket server section as needed.

## Usage

### Running the Converter

To run the audio converter, execute the `main.go` file:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This starts the server, allowing WebSocket connections for audio streaming. If working correctly, the server will convert `.WAV` files into `.FLAC` format.

### Test Conversion

1. Ensure a `.WAV` file (e.g., `file_example_WAV_2MG.wav`) is in your working directory.
2. Run the conversion script using the Go server.
3. Upon successful conversion, output is saved in `.flac` format (e.g., `output.flac`).

### WebSocket Communication

To connect via WebSocket, use a WebSocket client (e.g., Postman or a custom client script) to initiate a connection and stream the audio file to the server for conversion.

### Testing with Test Files

The project includes test files such as `test_tone_440hz.wav` and `maintest.go`. Run these to validate functionality:

```bash
# Run tests in maintest.go
go test maintest.go
```

## Contributing

To contribute, fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. Contributions are welcome for bug fixes, performance improvements, or new features.

### Guidelines for Contributions

- Ensure changes don't break existing functionality.
- Include tests for new features or changes.
- Keep code style consistent.
